Description:

The "Simple WebSocket Chat with RabbitMQ, Spring, and Redis" project is a web application demonstrating the use of WebSocket, RabbitMQ, Spring, and Redis technologies to implement a distributed and scalable chat.

Key Features:

WebSocket Implementation: Utilizes WebSocket technology to enable bidirectional communication between the client and server.

Message Exchange via RabbitMQ: Uses the RabbitMQ message broker to send messages between different clients.

State Persistence with Redis: Utilizes Redis to store information about chat rooms and messages for scalability and state recovery.

Horizontal Scalability: Designed with horizontal scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion of functionality and handling larger data volumes.

WebSocket Connection Testing: Includes unit tests to ensure the stability and correctness of WebSocket connections in the Spring Framework environment.
